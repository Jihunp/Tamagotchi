# Tamagotchi

## Concept:
The concept of the game is to create a Tamagotchi and I thought about who I would make it for and created a
user story. In the perspective of the user, I wrote it as follows: "My name is  Mark, your average 30 year old who is scouring
the internet looking for terribly constructed games to enjoy. It’s my hobby to see young developers create terrible code and enjoy
the craziness of wacky games. I want to be laughing while playing this game and I need some wacky options."
With Mark's interests in mind I created a list of things to do for the basics of the game.

Brainstorming Stage $ User Stories
As a user I want to play a game.
As a user I want to listen to music
As a user I want to click buttons to turn off music
As a user I want to “feed” my tamagotchi
As a user I want to “make my tamagotchi “sleep”
As a user I want to make my tamagotchi “eat”
As a user I want to create buttons for eat, sleep, and feed.
As a user I want to see my tamagotchi 

As a user I want to level up and evolve my tamagotchi
As a user I want to name my tamagotchi
As a user I want to see the progression of my exp as time goes on

As a user I want to be entertained
As a user I want the music to change everytime the tamagotchi transforms
As a user I want a button to self-destruct
As a user I want to do some crazy wonky stuff
As a user when I do something crazy or bizarre I want it to yell at me

As a user I want to pet my tamagotchi
As a user I want to win or lose the game
As a user I want to replay the game

After the initial brainstorm I made a basic checklist of what I wanted and continued to develop the code to intergrate into the game.
To win the game, the user has to get to the last evolution of the tamagotchi and not let the tamagatchi perish. In order to do so,
the user has to constantly press buttons to keep their tamagotchi rested, fed, and played with, or a variation of the three values.
After keeping the tamagotchi values to be in the safe levels then the tamagotchi rewards the players by evolving and transforming
into a different tamagotchi.
